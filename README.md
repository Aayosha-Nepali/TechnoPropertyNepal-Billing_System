# 💼 About TechnoPropertyNepal

TechnoPropertyNepal is a Python Programming Language based Billing System created as an academic project according to my University’s guidelines which involves developing a land rental management application for TechnoPropertyNepal, a private company that rents land across various locations in Nepal on a monthly contract basis. The system manages both land rentals and returns, storing all data in a .txt file.


🔧 Key Features:

    Text-Based Data Storage – Rental and return data are stored and retrieved from a .txt file

    Land Listings Management – View available land locations and rental status

    Rental Processing – Rent land based on user input and update rental records

    Return Handling – Return previously rented land and update availability

    Search Functionality – Search lands by location or rental status (optional if implemented)

    Simple Console Interface – Easy-to-use interface for user interaction


🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used:

    Python (IDLE) – Core development environment

    File Handling – .txt file used for persistent data storage


🎯 Project Objectives:

    Develop a working land rental system

    Strengthen Python coding skills through hands-on project development

    Create detailed documentation explaining the system's implementation
