# TechnoPropertyNepal-Billing_System
TechnoPropertyNepal is a Python Programming Language based Billing System created as an academic project according to my Universityâ€™s guidelines which involves developing a land rental management application for TechnoPropertyNepal, a private company that rents land across various locations in Nepal on a monthly contract basis. The system manages both land rentals and returns, storing all data in a .txt file.
